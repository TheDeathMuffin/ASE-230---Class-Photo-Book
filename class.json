I commute from the Lawrenceburg, Indiana area, where I also work as an employee for the Kroger Company on weekends and Mondays. I enjoy learning languages, but haven't had the time to commit to one recently. I greatly enjoy working with code, and tend to get hyped up when talking about things I find interesting. I may not be great with my time, but more than make up for it with tenacity, creativity and energy.",
